Minecraft Tunnel and Path Mapper "Minecraft Mapper"

MM is a program written in VPython which allows a player to map out the various tunnels, caves, 
paths, buildings, and other features the player has built into a 3D interactive map. The player 
can move around in the 3D map, zoom, move up and down, and and new features at any time.

    	nates, which can be found by pressing 'F3' in the Minecraft gui. Look for the section labe-
    	led "Blocks".
